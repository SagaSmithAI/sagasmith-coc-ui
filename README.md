Keeper-facing Astro/React workbench for the current `sagasmith-coc-mcp` contract.
It covers campaign-scoped investigation, CoC Module Pack state, investigators,
chases/combat, branches/snapshots/revisions, and an advanced console populated
only from the session's current native MCP exposure.

## Authority boundary

The browser does **not** connect to the stdio MCP server directly and never sends
`principal_id`. It calls an authenticated, sticky-session gateway at:

```text
POST {PUBLIC_COC_GATEWAY_BASE}/api/coc/mcp/tool
Cookie: <authenticated session>
Content-Type: application/json

{"tool":"campaign_query","arguments":{"action":"list"}}
```

The gateway owns authentication, injects the bound principal, keeps one MCP
session sticky, forwards `tools/list_changed`, and returns the tool's structured
result. The UI refuses caller-supplied `principal_id`; MCP remains authoritative
for authorization, dynamic exposure, random streams, revisions, idempotency, and
atomic settlement.

The authenticated sticky-session gateway is implemented by the sibling
`SagaSmith-coc-mcp` repository and can serve this built UI directly.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run dev
```

Configuration:

- `PUBLIC_COC_GATEWAY_BASE` — gateway origin, default `http://127.0.0.1:8768`
- `PUBLIC_COC_UI_MODE=demo` — explicit read-only demo mode

For a one-off local demo, open `/?demo=1`. Demo data is visibly marked,
read-only, and is not evidence that either sample campaign has been backtested.
Live connection failures never silently fall back to demo data.

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

The output is a static client in `dist/`; deploy it behind the same authenticated
origin as the gateway or configure CORS and credential handling deliberately.
